## Understanding ARIMA
ARIMA is a statistical model that captures the relationships between past observations and forecasted values by incorporating autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), and moving average (MA) components. The AR component models the relationship between an observation and a certain number of lagged observations, the MA component models the error of the model as a linear combination of error terms, and the I component deals with the integration of the time series data.

## Steps for Implementing ARIMA in Python: To use ARIMA for stock price prediction, we need to follow a fewÂ steps:
1. Import Libraries: Begin by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and statsmodels.
2. Load and Preprocess Data: Obtain historical stock price data for the desired stock and load it into a pandas DataFrame. Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as removing missing values or transforming the data if required.
3. Visualize Data: Plot the historical stock price data to gain insights into the trends, seasonality, and any other patterns present in the data. This visualization can help in selecting appropriate ARIMA parameters.
4. Stationarity Check: Conduct a stationarity check on the time series data using statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. If the data is non-stationary, apply differencing to make it stationary.
5. Determine ARIMA Parameters: Determine the appropriate order of the ARIMA model (p, d, q) based on the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots. These plots can guide you in selecting the optimal values for p, d, and q.
6. Train the ARIMA Model: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Fit the ARIMA model on the training data and tune the parameters using the selected values. Obtain the residuals to evaluate the model's performance.
7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the ARIMA model by comparing the predicted stock prices against the actual stock prices from the testing dataset. Calculate appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the model.
Future Price Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to forecast future stock prices. Provide a visual representation of the predicted prices along with the actual prices to observe the model's performance.
8. Web Application Development: Use Flask to develop a web application. Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the stock symbol or select from a list of available stocks. Additionally, provide options for selecting the prediction horizon (e.g., next 5 days, next month, etc.).
9. Display Predictions: Present the predicted stock prices to the user through the web application interface. Use visualizations, such as line graphs or candlestick charts, to showcase the predicted prices alongside historical prices.
10. Deployment: Deploy the web application on a hosting platform or a cloud server. Options such as Heroku, AWS, or PythonAnywhere offer easy deployment solutions for Flask-based applications.
